* Thinking
** Day 7 
  Seriously a *cool* problem.
  - (x) How to represent the operation structure
  - (x) Some operations have a direct number ???
    I will consider them a names, and fixed ther values.
  - ( ) How to read an operation from the instruction.
  - ( ) Do computation in a single 16 bits.
