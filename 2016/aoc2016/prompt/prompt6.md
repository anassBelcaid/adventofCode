\--- Day 6: Signals and Noise ---
----------

Something is jamming your communications with Santa. Fortunately, your signal is only partially jammed, and protocol in situations like this is to switch to a simple [repetition code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetition_code) to get the message through.

In this model, the same message is sent repeatedly. You've recorded the repeating message signal (your puzzle input), but the data seems quite corrupted - almost too badly to recover. *Almost*.

All you need to do is figure out which character is most frequent for each position. For example, suppose you had recorded the following messages:

```
eedadn
drvtee
eandsr
raavrd
atevrs
tsrnev
sdttsa
rasrtv
nssdts
ntnada
svetve
tesnvt
vntsnd
vrdear
dvrsen
enarar

```

The most common character in the first column is `e`; in the second, `a`; in the third, `s`, and so on. Combining these characters returns the error-corrected message, `easter`.

Given the recording in your puzzle input, *what is the error-corrected version* of the message being sent?
